  Rails Network Simulation in Haskell  

This project is a simulation of a railway network built with **Haskell**. It uses randomly generated weighted graphs to represent tracks and stations, and includes functionality to modify the network dynamically. Alongside the simulation, it also demonstrates data structure design (priority queues) and automated testing with **HUnit**.

##  What This Project Does  

- **Railway Network Generator** → Creates adjacency matrices that represent railway tracks with weighted edges.  
- **Lever Mechanism** → Simulates dynamic changes to the network by altering track weights.  
- **Custom Priority Queue** → Provides the foundation for shortest-path algorithms.  
- **Unit Testing** → Ensures reliability with a suite of HUnit test cases.
